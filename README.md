# Electron-interface-for-google-meet-bot

This is an desktop application which will just join the meeting and stays there until the meeting gets closed.
#Note:

This is still under-development.
There are lots of things to be added such as:-
1. Auto-login and log-out system according to the timetable.
2. Auto-notes generator.
3. Converting excel timetable into time-schedule.
4. Sync the bot with local time.
